	- Zhizhong Huang, Junping Zhang, and Hongming Shan
	- CVPR 2021,IEEE
	- Abstract: To minimize the impact of age variation on face recognition, age-invariant face recognition (AIFR) extracts identity-related discriminative features by minimizing the correlation between identity- and age-related features while face age synthesis (FAS) eliminates age variation by converting the faces in different age groups to the same group.
